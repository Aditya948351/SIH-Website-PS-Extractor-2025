The problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization task with numerous constraints such as safety, track resources, system of working, signalling system, platform availability, train schedules, and train priorities. As real-time decisions become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven systems powered by optimization algorithms and AI to enhance efficiency, punctuality, and utilization of railway infrastructure.<br><br><b>Detailed Description</b><br><br>Currently, experienced traffic controllers oversee operations and take real-time decisions—whether a train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted—based on operational conditions and institutional knowledge. With rising traffic volumes and higher expectations for punctuality, safety, and efficiency, manual decision-making alone is becoming insufficient.<br><br>The network is constrained by finite infrastructure—limited track sections, junctions, crossings, and platform capacities—shared by long-distance express, suburban local, freight, maintenance blocks, and unscheduled specials. Coordinating these movements across spatial (network layout) and temporal (scheduling) dimensions while maintaining safety and minimizing delays is formidable.<br><br>Within a section managed by a section controller, the core problem is to decide train precedence and crossings to maximize throughput and minimize overall train travel time, considering section characteristics (e.g., line capacity, gradients, signal placements) and varying train priorities. This represents a dynamic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially large solution space, further complicated by real-time disruptions (breakdowns, weather, rolling stock delays).

    "description": "<b>Background</b><br><br>The Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.<br><br>A blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey—from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., \"CollectionEvent,\" \"QualityTest,\" \"ProcessingStep\") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal—powered by the same blockchain ledger—to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.<br><br><b>Description</b><br><br>A permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey—from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a \"Collection Event.\" Subsequent \"Processing Step\" and \"Quality Test\" events—each embedding standardised metadata bundles—are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.<br><br>When formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product—complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles.

    "ps_number": "SIH25036",
    "description": "<b>Background</b><br><br>Microplastics — plastic particles less than 5 mm in size — have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics — such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy — are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.<br><br><b>Description</b><br><br>The project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques — such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance — combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.<br><br><b>Expected Solution</b><br><br>The expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10–100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation.<br>",

Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.<br><br>Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.<br><br><b>Description</b><br><br>The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.<br><br>However, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.<br><br>Traditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.<br><br><b>Expected Solution</b><br><br>To address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose an <b>AI-driven pipeline</b> that uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads.

In such structures, onions are exposed to extreme temperatures and relative humidity, which reduces the shelf life of onions and high storage loss. Improved onion storage technology will help in ensuring the availability of onions between seasons and obviate seasonal volatility in prices. The solutions could be in the form of improved, but cost-effective, materials and design of storage structures to manage temperature and relative humidity.<br><br><b>Description</b><br><br>Onion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations.<br><br>Various abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets.

    "description": "<b>Background:</b><br>Hallmarking is the accurate determination and official recording of the proportionate content of precious metal in the jewellery/artefacts or bullion/coins. The hallmarking of gold jewellery was started in year 2000 and has been made mandatory since 23 June 2021 and presently covers 361 districts.<br><br>The Indian Standard, IS 1417 2016 \"Gold and gold alloys, jewellery/artefacts-fineness and marking specification\" covers hallmarking of six grades of gold jewellery/gold artefacts viz. 14K, 18K, 20K, 22K, 23K and 24K carats. The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 \"Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method\" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.<br><br>The fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.<br><br>Further, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 \"Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test\". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.<br><br>There is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 \"Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES\". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.<br><br>India's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.<br><br>In the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method.<br><br><b>Expected Solution:</b><br>a. Develop and implement a <b>non-destructive assaying method</b> that matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances).<br>b.

    "description": "Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise that stretches far beyond train operations. Every business day the organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links—often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax: \n● Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations. \n● Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening.\n● Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities. \n● Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them. \n● Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches. \n\nAs KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder—from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors—with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source. Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL’s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi.",

    "description": "Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables: \n1. Fitness Certificates – validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments.\n2. Job-Card Status – open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo. \n3. Branding Priorities – contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours. \n4. Mileage Balancing – kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear. \n5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots – available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning. \n6. Stabling Geometry – physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time. \nAt present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00–23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone:\n● Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI. \n● Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost. \n● Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties. \n● Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly—neither in staffing nor in cognitive load. Therefore, KMRL requires an integrated, algorithm-driven decision-support platform that can: \n● Ingest heterogeneous inputs (Maximo exports, IoT fitness sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in near-real-time. \n● Enforce rule-based constraints and multi-objective optimisation (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding exposure). \n● Generate a ranked induction list with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts, and “what-if” simulation. \n● Learn from historical outcomes via machine-learning feedback loops to improve forecast accuracy over time. \nSuch a system will transform induction planning from a manual reconciliation exercise into a reproducible, auditable, data-driven process—delivering higher fleet availability, lower lifecycle cost, and an enhanced passenger experience while freeing operations staff to focus on strategic exceptions rather than routine data wrangling.",

Therefore, the problem statement covers development of a travel related software app that can be installed on mobile phones that could capture trip related information - trip number, origin, time, mode, destination etc - such that a travel related activity and trip chain can be established. Also the number and details of the accompanying travellers also can be captured if possible. Consent from the user is required. Some of these details can be automatically detected and some details can be nudged to be filled by the user. Once these trip details are complete, it can be saved in a server/ database which can be accessed by NATPAC Scientists for planning purposes.",

    "description": "Urban traffic congestion in Indian cities is worsened by the limitations of current urban planning software, which often assumes ideal, well-maintained road conditions typical of developed countries. Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads—such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors.\n\nManually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted.\n\nTo address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows—leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI—that significantly streamline the process.\n\nThe solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning.\n\nProposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.\n\nFor more information on relevant tools, please refer to the following links:\n\nDriving Scenario Designer – Design driving scenarios, configure sensors, and generate synthetic data – MATLAB\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ref/drivingscenariodesigner-app.html?requestedDomain=\n\nGitHub - MathWorks/OpenTrafficLab\nhttps://github.com/mathworks/OpenTrafficLab\n\nCreate Driving Scenario Variations Programmatically – MATLAB & Simulink\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/create-driving-scenario-variations-programmatically.html?requestedDomain=\n\nSensor Simulation and Virtual Scene Design with the Driving Scenario Designer App, Part 1 – MATLAB\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/videos/driving-scenario-designer-1529302116471.html?s_tid=srchtitle_videos_main_1_driving+scenario\n\nImport OpenStreetMap Data into Driving Scenario – MATLAB & Simulink\nhttps://in.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/import-openstreetmap-data-into-driving-scenario.html",

Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide.\nDescription:\nThe challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed  high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions.\nExpected Solution:\nStudent teams should outline a software-only virtual-classroom ecosystem that delivers clear audio and concise visual content on limited bandwidth, supports interactive live as well as recorded sessions, and allows easy content access for learners who may need to download materials during off-peak hours-all without relying on specialised hardware or costly licences.",

Counsellors and mentors need a mechanism that surfaces risk indicators-faliing attendance, high number of attempts exhausted to pass a particular subject, reducing test scores-weeks earlier.\nDescription:\nAttendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously.\nCommercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system\nmust be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.This challenge epitomises the hackathon spirit: take what is already present, integrate it cleverly, and produce meaningful impact using\nmachine learning.\nExpected SoIution:\nParticipants  are expected to build a consolidated digitaI dashboard that automatically ingests attendance,assessment scores, and other student related dala;applies clear, rule-based  thresholds to identify at-risk students; highIights them in an intuitive visual format; and dispatches regular notifications to mentors and guardians, ensuring early,data-driven intervention achieved entirely through suitable machine learning approaches.",

    "description": "Background:\nAdmissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are maintained in separate ledgers. Students queue at multiple counters; staff re-enter identical data; and administrators lack a real-time institutional overview.\nDescription:\nComprehensive ERP suites can unify data but remain out of financial reach for many public colleges. Yet much of the required functionality-customised online forms, central data tables, automated receipts, real-time dashboards-already exists in ubiquitous cloud office suites. By intelligently connecting these services, an institution can create a single source of truth without large capital outlay. Essential components include streamlined admission intake, automated fee receipting, live hostel occupancy tracking, and summary dashboards for higher officials. Data security, role-based access and regular back-ups must be baked in from day one. Because staff is already familiar with basic spreadsheet and form tools, the learning curve remains shallow, ensuring broad adoption. Hackathon participants can demonstrate how thoughtful process mapping and lightweight scripting turn an assortment of familiar apps into a cohesive, low-cost ERP that any college can replicate.                                                                                                                    Expected Solution:\nTeams should outline an integrated workflow in which admission data flows seamlessly into a central student database, financial transactions automatically generate digital receipts, hostel and library records update the same database in real time, and summary dashboards present key metrics to administrators all delivered through interlinked, widely available software services rather than proprietary or hardware-intensive solutions.",

    "description": "Background:\nCampus offices answer hundreds of repetitive queries-fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes often from students more comfortable in Hindi or other regional languages. Long queues and communication gaps strain both staff and learners..\n\nDescription:\nWhile answers reside in circulars and PDFs, students prefer conversational guidance. A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational-Al services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly.\n\nExpected Solution:\nStudent innovators should develop a multilingual conversational assistant that ingests institutional FAQs, recognises and responds to student queries in at least five regional languages, maintains context across follow-up questions, logs interactions for review, and integrates seamlessly into the college's existing web and messaging channels-achieving equitable, round-the-clock information access in a user friendly manner.",
